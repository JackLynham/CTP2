Ctp Notes

Start with twol lines and split them to generate a grid of roads. 
Every Split takes a random percent value which defines the road Sizes and Intersection
I then calaculate the Left and right side of my Road and how many times i split.


Ultimatly these form what our city Looks like 



Road Class 
Gets a start and an end point for each road returns distance and returns the end of roads.

Point Class 
 This class is used mainly to conver the postions into a vector 3 as well as the end postions of the roads 

Intersection Class
This class gets the list of points and checks if theres and intersection.

- Drawing Roads
In my update loop im getting the mouse postion and saving the point i click as the postion 
where roads need to be drawn 


Road Network 
Get length of exsiting street which we calculate using start and end point plus random
Then I Calculate left and right by getting the split 
perpendicular points (at an angle of 90Â° to a given line, plane, or surface or to the ground.) 
and use them to make a new road.

Next we check if any new roads to be placed are intersecting with any exsiting road if they do check 
intersetion points to avoid odd behaviour. 

We then have some Algorthyims which is one of the links. 

-Add City Center 
Draws a road for every two points as a road needs start and end point
